# Jarvis : Your in device voice assistant 

Hello folks, this is my AI assitant named Jarvis, which can answer by listening to your queries! 

# How it works ? 

Jarvis uses state of the art models like : 

  - `Whisper` for speech to text conversion
  - `llama3` for response to the text received
  - `gTTS` (Google-Text-To-Speech) to convert the response to Voice

# Architecture 

It's the following chain : 

  Speech -> `Whisper` -> text -> `llama3` -> `gTTS` -> Speech (Voice response)
